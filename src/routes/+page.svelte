			<h2 class="h2">Welcome to AMS-EXPLORER 👋</h2>
			<p>
				AMS-Explorer is a rich web-application for content found in Automobilista 2.
				Just like ams2cars.info, this web-application aims at giving the user the ability to search and filter for Cars 
				but aso Tracks, Track Layouts, real history of these and game mechanics.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have to admit: without the work from oez on ams2cars.info, this project wouldnt even exist. 
				I used his website often to find clear information about a car in a easy to understand layout.
			</p>
			<h3>But then - why this 'Explorer'? 🕵️</h3>
			<p>
				Very easy to explain. First of all I wanted a new project to learn new webdev skills. That worked so far.
				Second, I want to give the community something "back" and something I miss on ams2cars.info: 
				Tracks and other features like calculators, game mechanic tutorials and so on.
				Thats what I want to build here. A big Explorer for all Automobilista related content.

				This website will need a lot of work to be the finished project I have in mind.
				And even then .. lets be real .. it will never be done 😀. Here is a small list of the things
				I would like to add over time.
