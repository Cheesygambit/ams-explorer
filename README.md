# The idea
AMS-Explorer is a rich web-application for content found in Automobilista 2. Like ams2cars.info, this web-application aims at giving the user the ability to search and filter for Cars but aso Tracks, Track Layouts, real history of these and game mechanics.

# ToDo
- Basic Web-App structure
- Database
    - Cars
    - Tracks
    - Layouts
- Working filtering
- Track & Car Categories
- Game mechanics (Damage, Pitstop, Weather and much more)
- Randomizer for Track and Car combos
